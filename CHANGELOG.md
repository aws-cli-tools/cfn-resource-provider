## Unreleased

## 0.1.1 (2018-11-27)

This library supports you in creating [custom resources for AWS CloudFormation][docs-aws-custom-resources] in a type-safe manner, using Rust. It is meant to be used in conjunction with @srijs [rust-aws-lambda], a library that prepares your Rust binaries to run natively in the Go 1.x runtime of AWS Lambda.
You can consult the documentation for information on how to use this library. Feel free to [open a new issue][new-issue] if you have any questions.
